Bugs & Incomplete features:

	Tab dragging doesn't change tab to new column when released, also has incorrect position.
	Autocomplete has a tendency to add extra characters, also it's not easy to use.
	Javascript inheritence shortcut does not work.


Things I want:

	Renderer should indicate to main that it is fully loaded and ready.
	Project view folder collapse, and better indication of depth.
	Project view file search.
	```src/shared/config.js``` is an inconvenient place for plugin things, editor could probably look in ``src/plugins`` instead.
